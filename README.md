# BearcatEventPlanner
Group 6 Final Project Enterprise App Dev

## Introduction
The University of Cincinnati Event Planner allows university staff to create, manage, and promote events, while students can easily browse, register, and track their participation. This system provides a streamlined interface for event creation, registration, and tracking, integrating features such as calendar syncing and notifications. Users can interact with the platform through a simple UI or programmatically via RESTful service endpoints, making event management accessible and efficient for both organizers and participants.
